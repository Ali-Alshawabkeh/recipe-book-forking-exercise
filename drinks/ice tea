Homemade Iced Tea
Ingredients:

    4 cups (1 liter) water
    4 black tea bags (or your favorite tea)
    1/4 cup sugar or honey (adjust to taste)
    1 lemon, sliced (optional)
    Fresh mint leaves (optional)
    Ice cubes
    Optional: fruit slices (peach, berries, etc.) for a fruity flavor

Instructions:

    Boil the water: In a pot, bring 4 cups of water to a rolling boil.

    Brew the tea: Once the water boils, remove it from the heat and add the tea bags. Let the tea steep for about 5-7 minutes, depending on how strong you like your tea.

    Sweeten the tea: While the tea is still hot, stir in the sugar or honey until fully dissolved. Adjust sweetness to your taste.

    Cool down: Remove the tea bags and let the tea cool to room temperature. You can speed this up by transferring it to the fridge.

    Serve over ice: Fill a glass with ice cubes, pour the cooled tea over the ice, and stir.

    Add flavor: Garnish with fresh lemon slices and mint leaves. For a fruity twist, add peach slices or fresh berries.

    Enjoy: Serve immediately, or store in the fridge for later use.
